MLRA 158 - Alae sandy loam 3 to 7 percent slopes

This map unit covers 980 acres and was originally mapped as Alae sandy loam 3 to 7 percent slopes on the Island of Maui (HI980).  On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 3 different MLRAs (MLRA 157  17 acres; 158 -505 acres and MLRA 163-458 acres). The OSD type location is MLRA 158. There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition.  


A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD description from Island of Maui is the same as the current OSD. However, both have different taxonomic classification. The TUD description (Medial, isohyperthermic Mollic Vitrandepts) is from 1938. However, the OSD was updated on 2003 as Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Vitritorrands. The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Island of Maui.


The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy.  However, this pedon was not analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.


Based on the ArcMap evaluation and Pedon classificationthe following problema were detected:

**Particle size  This pedon has Strongly contrasting particle-size class . There is no way to calculate the percentage of clay or sand fractions since no data provided in the pedon description.  However, the texture class of all horizon are given. Basically, this pedon is sandy loamy (ashy or Course-loamy) over gravelly or very gravelly Coarse and very coarse sand (sandy or Sandy- Skeletal). I will suggest the following particle size family:

	Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal (pag 322; 8); or 
	Course-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal (pag 322; 26)

**Minerology
There is no way to determinate the mineralogy since no data . However, if the Particle size is Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal maybe the mineralogy could be GLASSY  or GLASSY OVER MIXED???

**Suborder
Base on the median values from the R report of all Alae Map unit, the average for the Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) is 431 mm (17 inches). The moisture regime is Aridic, so the suborder would still as Torrands.

**Great Group
There is no lab data to calculate the water retention. However, base on the sandy texture , probably this pedon meet the criteria for the great group Vitritorrands .

**Subgroup
Base on the Pedon description, the last 2 horizon has present of Pedogenic carbonate accumulation, If we call this horizon as Calcic Horizon (36-140 cm), then the subgroup would be Calcic Vitrirorrands (pag 95) instead of Typic Vitritorrands

**Taxonomic classification 
The current OSD classification is Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Vitritorrands. If we decide to make change in the particle size, minerology and  subgroup, the following classification is suggested 

	Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, glassy, isohyperthermic Calcic Vitrirorrands

At this moment we are not going to make any change to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data.

MLRA 158 - Alae sandy loam 3 to 7 percent slopes

Introduction

This map unit is formed in volcanic ash and recent alluvium derived from basic igneous rock on alluvial fans on the island of Maui. The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 338 to 494 millimeters (13 to 19 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.). Elevation ranges from 2to 136 meters (7 to 446 feet).

The Alae component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 7 percent. This component is on alluvial fans and stream terraces alluvial fans, Haleakala shield volcanoes. The parent material consists of volcanic ash derived from basalt over alluvium derived from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is excessively drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 4s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 20 percent.

Geomorphic Description
Landscape: Shield volcano (representative), Islands; 
Landform: Alluvial fan (Representative), stream terraces, ash fields, mountain slopes.

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 980 acres and was originally mapped as Alae sandy loam 3 to 7 percent slopes (hq74) on the Island of Maui (HI980).  On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 3 different MLRAs (MLRA 157  17 acres; 158 -505 acres and MLRA 163-458 acres) but was correlated to MLRA 163. The OSD type location is in MLRA 158. The new map unit MLRA 158 - Alae sandy loam 3 to 7 percent slopes (2yyrw) will be correlated to MLRA 158. 

Future Projects

Major component Classification
A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD is the same as the OSD. The OSD was updated on 2003 as Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Vitritorrands. 
We are using the current soil Key of taxonomy to update the taxonomic classification. Base on the current pedon description, the Horizon designation, particle size, minerology and subgroup need to be changes. 
However, due to the lack of documentation and data for this component. Therefore, we support a future project to perform soil samples in order to collect additional profile descriptions and lab data that would help to address those issues.

Minor components
There are some problem regarding with the map unit composition due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data documents for this Map Unit. However, some inclusions were capture from the Soil Survey publications across the MLRA 157, MLRA 158 and MLRA 163, but we are lacking the percentages.
Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and 163 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. At this time, we have recommended to utilize the existing data, but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

Slope Phase
According with the manuscript this map unit should has a slope ranges from 3 to 7 percent slopes. However, based on the MUsum report and Arcmap evaluation, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 5 percent slope on Maui Island. These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

Delineation 
Based on our ArcMap evaluation, there are few map unit polygons have some delineation off the map unit concept. This delineation are in MLRA 157 (17 acres). Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to evaluate this delineation in order to find fill the concept of the map unit, soil interpretations, and landforms.

Lab data 
There is no pedons of Alae in the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Soil Characterization Database. The only pedon for this Soil series is the TUD (OSD).  The OSD (TUD) description does not have enough information to describe the taxonomic classification properly. Therefore, it is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

Ecological site
There is no Ecological Site information for Maui. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Alae soils across the MLRA 158.

MLRA 158 - Alae cobbly sandy loam 0 to 3 percent slopes

This map unit covers 785 acres (ArMap). The map unit was originally mapped as Alae cobbly sandy loam o to 3 percent slopes on Island of Maui, Hawaii (HI980). This map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 158 (Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes), and MLRA 163 (Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains) in Maui. 

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD description from Island of Maui is the same as the current OSD. However, both have different taxonomic classification. The TUD description (Medial, isohyperthermic Mollic Vitrandepts) is from 1938.

The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy.  However, this pedon was not analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.


Based on the ArcMap evaluation and Pedon classificationthe following problema were detected:

However, the texture class of all horizon are given. Basically, this pedon is sandy loamy (ashy or Course-loamy) over gravelly or very gravelly Coarse and very coarse sand (sandy or Sandy- Skeletal). I will suggest the following particle size family:

Taxonomic classification 
The current OSD classification is Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Vitritorrands. If we decide to make change in the particle size, minerology and  subgroup, the following classification is suggested 

	Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, glassy, isohyperthermic Calcic Vitrirorrands

At this moment we are not going to make any change to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data.

Introduction
This map unit is formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock on low mountain slopes on the island of Maui. The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 1146 to 1527 millimeters (45 to 60 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 25 to 26 degrees C. (77 to 79 degrees F.). Elevation ranges from 36 to 179 meters (36 to 179 feet).

The Alaeloa component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 7 percent. This component is on mountain slopes, Haleakela shield volcanoes. The parent material consists of residuum weathered from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2e. Irrigated land capability classification is 2e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. 

Minor components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit.

Minor components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit. However, there are some polygon mapped in urban area. This polygon needs to be evaluated and probably add Urban land as minor or major component base on the percentage.
Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to evaluate this delineation in order to find fill the concept of the map unit, soil interpretations, and landforms.

Slope Phase
According with the manuscript this map unit should has a slope ranges from 3 to 7 percent slopes. However, based on the MUsum report and Arcmap evaluation, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 2 to 13 percent slope on Maui Island. These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

Lab data 
There are 6 Pedons in NASIS for Alaeloa soil series. Three of this six pedons have lab data. Those pedons have different taxonomic classification. Only 2 pedons (MP83NM644036 & MP80NM666000  this pedons were classified as Alama Soil Series previously) have the same classification as the current OSD classification Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults. The OSD Pedon in NASIS (89HI003007) has a different particle size family and minerology than the current OSD classification.  Both pedons were correlated on 2007.

The coordinated place them in the following map unit -OFC  Olelo silty clay, 15 to 50 percent slopes, MLRA 164; rRS- Rough broken and stony land 

The taxonomy class was evaluated using the lab data (Pedon ID: 89HI003007) and the current OSD pedon description.  Base on the evaluation we caught the following issues: 

Epipedon  This pedon meet the  Mollic Epipedon  from 0 to 25 cm (Ap). The dark color (%YR 3/3) and the base saturation (by NH4OAc) More than 50 %  (Lab data of 58% - SB%) (see below). HOWEVER, the pH value are strongly acid (5.4).
Particle Size- Base on the lab data, the control section for this pedon is 25-75 cm (pag 319- C.4). The Particle-Size and Substitute Classes of Mineral Soils is Very-fine (Pag 322- 12) instead of Fine. The Control section has 78% clay. 

Minerology-Base on the Mineralogy Classes [ page 325 - Section A ], the X-Ray data show presence of Kaolinite in this pedon (see below). However, there is no value of the percentage for Kaolinite. In this section, the class that will feet this pedon would be A - 8. All other soils in section A- Mixed. However, If I proceed on the following sections, the next section that may apply would be the Section D. [ Other mineral soils and soils in Terric subgroups of Histosols and Histels that have a clayey, clayey-skeletal, fine, or very-fine particle-size class and have horizons or layers composed of mineral soil materia ],This pedon meet the criteria for the Fe2O3 ) for the Parasesquic class but there are not data or description of gibbsite on this profile. 
  
Suborder- Base on the lab data , this pedon meet the criteria for Humults suborder.

Great Group - If the last horizon of this Pedon (147-178 cm) qualify for a Cr , then the great group would be Haplohumults instead of Palehumults 

Subgroup - Base on the median values from the R report of all Alaeloa Map unit, the average for the Mean Annual Precipitation is 1315 mm (52 inches). Is it the moisture regime Udic instead of Ustic? If the moisture regime is Ustic, then the Subgroup is Ustic Palehumults if not, would be Typic Palehumults.


Taxonomic classification  - The current OSD classification is Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults. However, the following classification are suggested if we decide to make change in the particle size family, minerology or great group:

	Very-Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults.
	Very-Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Typic Palehumults.
	Very-Fine, mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Palehumults.
	Very-Fine, mixed, isohyperthermic Typic Haplohumults.


At this moment we are not going to make any change to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data.

MLRA 158 - Alaeloa silty clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes

Introduction
This map unit is formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock on low mountain slopes on the island of Maui. The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 1209 to 1698 millimeters (48 to 67 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 26 degrees C. (75 to 79 degrees F.). Elevation ranges from 45 to 347 meters (148 to 1,138 feet).
The Alaeloa component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 7 to 15 percent. This component is on mountain slopes, Haleakela shield volcanoes. The parent material consists of basic igneous rock. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3e. Irrigated land capability classification is 3e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   

Minor components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit.

Geomorphic Description
Landscape: Shield volcano (representative), Islands; 
Landform: mountain slopes (Representative).

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 1,369 acres and was originally mapped as Alaeloa silty clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes on the Island of Maui (HI980).  This map unit is mapped in 2 different MLRAs. Most of the acres (1,367) are mapped in MLRA 158 - Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes. Only 2 acres are mapped in MLRA 164 (Humid and Very Humid Steep and Very Steep Mountain Slopes. 

Future Projects
Minor components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit. Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to evaluate this delineation in order to find fill the concept of the map unit, soil interpretations, and landforms.

Slope Phase
According with the manuscript this map unit should has a slope ranges from 7 to 15 percent slopes. However, based on the MUsum report and Arcmap evaluation, there are few map unit polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 5 to 24 percent slope on Maui Island. These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

Lab data 
There are 6 Pedons in NASIS for Alaeloa soil series. Three of this six pedons have lab data. Those pedons have different taxonomic classification. The Lab pedon MP83NM644036 & MP80NM666000  this pedons were classified as Alama Soil Series previously. Only 2 pedons have the same classification as the current OSD classification Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults. The OSD Pedon in NASIS (89HI003007) has a different particle size family and minerology than the current OSD classification.Therefore, it is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

Ecological site 
There is no Ecological Site information for Maui. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Alae soils across the MLRA 158.

MLRA 158 - Alaeloa silty clay, 3 to 7 percent slopes

This map unit covers 519 acres and was originally mapped as Alaeloa silty clay, 3 to 7 percent slopes on the Island of Maui (HI980).  This map unit is mapped in MLRA 158 - Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes.

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD from Island of Oahu (the five Island Soil Survey) is the same as the current OSD.  The TUD description (Clayey, oxidic, isohyperthermic, Orthoxic Tropohumults) is from1938. However, the OSD was updated on 2017 (Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults).   This pedon was analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska (the Pedon ID: 89HI003007).The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Island of Oahu and Maui.

There are 6 Pedons in NASIS for Alaeloa soil series). Only 2 pedons have the same classification as the current OSD classification Fine, parasesquic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults. Three of this six pedons are the pedons from NCSS that have lab data. Those pedons have different taxonomic classification. The pedons :  MP83NM644036 & MP80NM666000;  were previously classified as Alama Soil Series .

This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 1,633 acres in Maui County and was originally mapped as Alaeloa silty clay, 15 to 35 percent slopes on the Islands of Maui (HI980) and Molokai (HI950).  This map unit is found in MLRA 164.

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit. 

Plan 
The 2015 project: SDJR - MLRA 158, 164, 167  Alaeloa silty clay, 15 to 35 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol (2w02s), 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit from 2 different national mapunit symbols. No minor components will be assigned during this SDJR project. The new MLRA map unit Alaeloa silty clay, 15 to 35 percent slopes, MLRA 164, will be added to the Islands of Maui (HI980) and Molokai (HI950) legends. The table below summarizes the mapunits and survey areas for the 2015 SDJR project.

Map Unit Concept -MLRA 158 - Ewa silty clay loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes

This map unit covers 530 (ArcMap) acres and was originally mapped as Ewa silty clay loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes on the Island of Maui (HI980).  On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs. There are 158 acres mapped in Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slope (MLRA 158) and 340 acres mapped in Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains (MLRA 163). 

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD from Island of Oahu (the five Island Soil Survey ) is the same of the current OSD.  The TUD description (1938) and the current OSD (2003) have the same taxonomic class Fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Aridic Haplustolls. This pedon was not analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.

The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Island of Oahu and Maui, Hawaii.

The Ewa OSD (TUD) coordinated place the Pedon location inside the Map Unit - MuD  Molokai Silty Clay loam, 15 to 25 percent slopes. This map doesnt have minor component. The OSD type location is on the Island of Oahu in the MLRA 165. The current location needs to be reviewed and, possibly, the type location will have to be relocated. Therefore, we support a future project to address those issues.

The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy. Base on the pedon description the following problem were detected:

	Control section  

If we recognize the Argillic Horizons (Bt), then the control section is 46-96 cm, the first 50 cm of the argillic hz (C.4 page319). 
	Particle Size- 

There is no definitive way to calculate the percentage of clay since no data on clay fractions is provided in the pedon description.  However, the texture class of all horizon are given. The texture from the control section (46-96 cm) is silty clay loam, this pedon can have either Fine or Fine-loamy particle size family. Also, there is no rock fragment describe in the Control section

	Minerology

There is no lab data. However, based on the OSD description seem to be present of mineral 1:1. 

	Great Group
Base on the Pedon description, this pedon has Argillic horizon. According with the Key of Taxonomy, this pedon has a Argiustolls Great Group instead of Haplustolls. 

	Subgroup
The median values from the R report of all Ewa Map unit, the average for the Mean Annual Precipitation is 684 mm (27 inches) . The moisture regime Ustic. 
If the moisture regime is Ustic, then the Subgroup is Typic Argiustolls instead of Aridic Haplustolls

On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 3 different MLRAs (MLRA 158, MLRA 163  and MLRA 166). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 and MLRA 163 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures.

Minor components
This map unit should be investigated to confirm minor component composition. It is recommended to create a future MLRA project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and update the MLRA MU and DMU.

MLRA boundary
On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA 158 and MLRA 163). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 and MLRA 163 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures. 

Lab data 
There are 2 lab pedons in NCSS for Ewa Soil Series. However, the coordinated place the location in the map unit MnC- Mamala cobbly silty clay loam, 0 to 12 percent slopes, MLRA 163, where Ewa is a minor component (10%). Also, the information is incomplete. The OSD (TUD) description does not have enough information to describe the taxonomic classification properly. Therefore, it is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

Ecological site
There is no Ecological Site information for Maui. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Ewa soils across the MLRA 163 and MLRA 158

MLRA 164  Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes

Introduction
The soils in this map unit consist of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock. Halawa soils are on gently sloping to very steep mid elevation mountain slopes. The mean annual rainfall is about 30 to 60 inches (RV=1,143 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 67 to 71 degrees F. (RV=21 degrees C.) Elevation ranges from 500 to 2,000 feet (152 to 610 meters).

The Halawa component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. This component is on uplands. The parent material consists of basic igneous rock. Depth to a root restrictive layer, bedrock, paralithic, is 40 to 70 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 6 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4e. Irrigated land capability classification is 4e. This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 2,191 acres in Maui County and was originally mapped as Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes on the Islands of Molokai (HI950) and Maui (HI980).  This map unit is found in MLRA 164.

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because the soil survey manuscript did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit. 

Plan 
The 2015 project: SDJR - MLRA 163, 164, 165 - Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol (2w02w), 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for MLRA 164 - Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes from 2 different national mapunit symbols. No minor components will be assigned during this SDJR project. The new map unit Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes, MLRA 164 will be assigned to the Island of Molokai (HI950) and Maui (HI980) legends. The table below summarizes the mapunits and survey areas for the 2015 SDJR project. 

Mapunit Name	Area Symbol	Area Name	Mapunit Symbol	National Mapunit Symbol	DMU Desription
Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes 	HI950	Island of Molokai Area, Hawaii	HID	hq4h	950HID
Halawa silty clay, 3 to 25 percent slopes 	HI980	Island of Maui Area, Hawaii 	HID	hq7m	980HID

Future Projects
This map unit should be investigated to confirm component composition. It is recommended to create a future MLRA project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 164 and update the MLRA MU and DMU.

There seems to be insufficient documentation in NASIS and there is no laboratory data at the NSSC Laboratory for the Halawa component. It is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

MLRA 163 - Iao silty clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes

This map unit covers 691 acres and was originally mapped as Iao silty clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes the Island of Maui (HI980).  Most of this map unit is mapped in MLRA 163 -Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains (426 acres) and MLRA 158 - Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes (265 acres). 

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD from the Island of Maui (five Island Soil Survey) is the same of the current OSD.  The TUD taxonomic class (Fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Haplustolls) is from1938. The current OSD taxonomic class Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls is from 2000. This pedon was not analyzed by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.

The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Island of Maui

The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy. Based on the ArcMap evaluation and Pedon classification the following problem were detected:

Type Location - The Iao OSD (TUD) coordinated place the Pedon location inside the Map Unit WvC- Wailuku Silty Clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes.  This map unit doesnt have minor component. The current location needs to be reviewed and, possibly, the type location will have to be relocated. Therefore, we support a future project to address those issues.

Control section  If we recognize the Hz 61-122 with a Argillic Horizon (Bt), then the control section is 64-114 cm, the first 50 cm of the argillic hz (C.4 page319). 
	
Paricle size - There is no definitive way to calculate the percentage of clay  since no data on clay fractions is provided in the pedon description.  However, the texture class of all horizon are given. The texture from the control section (64-114 cm) is clay (> 40-100% clay), the pedon fits the Fine particle-size class (C.11). Also, there is no rock fragment describe in the Control section.

Minerology - There is no way to determinate the mineralogy since no data . 

Cation-exchange activity class - There is no definitive way to determinate the Cation-exchange activity class  since no lab data on cation-exchange capacity  is provide in the pedon description. However,  It ranges from pH 6.8 to 7.0. so Could have a Active or  ""superactive"" activity class. 

Great Group -Base on the Pedon description, this pedon has Argillic horizon. According with the Key of Taxonomy, this pedon has a Argiustolls Great Group instead of Haplustolls. 

Subgroup -The medan values from the R report of all Iao Map unit, the average for the Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) is 840 mm (33 inches). The moisture regime Ustic, right? Also, this pedon have a Mollic epipedon (0-122 cm) > 50 cm thick (0-122 cm).Base on this description, the Subgroup is Pachi Argiustolls instead of Cumulic Haplustolls

Taxonomic classification - The current OSD classification is Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls. If we decide to make change in the great group and subgroup, then the following classification is suggested:

	***Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Pachi Argiustolls

At this moment we are not going to make any change to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data.

MLRA 163 - Iao silty clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes

Introduction

This map unit is formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock on alluvial fans on the island of Maui. The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 568 to 980 millimeters (22 to 39 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.). Elevation ranges from 2 to 97 meters (7 to 318 feet).

The Iao component makes up 95 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. This component is on alluvial fans and isthmus alluvial fans, Haleakala shield volcanoes. The parent material consists of alluvium derived from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is high. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3c. Irrigated land capability classification is 1 This soil does not meet hydric criteria.

Geomorphic Description
Landscape: Shield volcano (representative), Islands;

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 691 acres and was originally mapped as Iao silty clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes the Island of Maui (HI980).  Most of this map unit is mapped in MLRA 163 -Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains (426 acres) and MLRA 158 - Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes (265 acres). 

Future Projects

Type Location
The Iao OSD (TUD) coordinated place the Pedon location inside the Map Unit WvC- Wailuku Silty Clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes.  This map unit doesnt has minor component. The current location needs to be reviewed and, possibly, the type location will have to be relocated. Therefore, we support a future project to address those issues.

Major component Classification
A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD is the same as the OSD. The OSD was updated on 2000 as Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls. 
We are using the current soil Key of taxonomy to update the taxonomic classification. Base on the current pedon description, the Horizon designation, great group and subgroup need to be changes. 
However, due to the lack of documentation and data for this component. Therefore, we support a future project to perform soil samples in order to collect additional profile descriptions and lab data that would help to address those issues.

Minor components
There are some problem regarding with the map unit composition due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data documents for this Map Unit. However, some inclusions were capture from the Soil Survey publications across the MLRA 158 and MLRA 163, but we are lacking the percentages.

Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and 163 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. At this time, we have recommended to utilize the existing data, but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.


MLRA boundary
On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA 158  and MLRA 163). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 and MLRA 163 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures. 

Slope Phase
According with the manuscript this map unit should has a slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent slopes. However, based on the MUsum report and Arcmap evaluation, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 8 percent slope on Maui Island. These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

Lab data 
There is no pedons of Iao  in the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Soil Characterization Database. The only pedon for this Soil series is the TUD (OSD).  The OSD (TUD) description does not have enough information to describe the taxonomic classification properly. Therefore, it is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

Ecological site
There is no Ecological Site information for Maui. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Alae soils across the MLRA 163 and MLRA 158.

MLRA 163 - Jaucas sand, 0 to 15 percent slopes

Introduction

Jaucas series consists of very deep, excessively drained, calcareous, sandy soils formed along the coast on from coral and sea shells. Typically, these soils have pale brown sand surface layers about 13 inches thick. The underlying layer to a depth of 60 inches or more is very pale brown sand. The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout the profile. Permeability is rapid, and runoff is very slow to slow. The hazard of water erosion is slight, but wind erosion is a severe hazard where vegetation has been removed.The mean annual rainfall ranges from 13 to 77 inches (330 to 1950 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F (23 to 25 degrees C). Elevation ranges from 0 to 1142 feet (0 to 348 meters).
The Jaucas component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. This component is on above high tide beaches, islands. The parent material consists of sand sized coral and sea shells. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is excessively drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is rarely flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 7s.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 95 percent.

Spatial Distribution

This map unit covers 10000 acres in Maui and Oahu County and was originally mapped as Jaucas sand, 0 to 15 percent slopes. This map unit is found in MLRA 158 Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes, MLRA 163 Alluvial Fans and Costal Plains; MLRA 164 Humid and Very Humid Steep and  Very Steep Mountain Slopes;  MLRA 166 Very Stony Land and Rock Land , MLRA 167 Humid Oxidic Soils on Low and Intermediate Rolling Mountain Slopes. 

Minor Components

No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit. 

Plan 

The 2015 project: MLRA 163 - Jaucas sand, 0 to 15 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for Jaucas sand, 0 to 15 percent slopes from 4 different national mapunit symbols. No minor components will be assigned during this SDJR project. The table below summarizes the mapunits and survey areas for the 2015 SDJR project.

Future Projects

This map unit should be investigated to confirm component composition. It is recommended to create a future MLRA project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 163 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

There is no Ecological Site information for Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Oahu. Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group across the MLRA 163. 

The Jaucas map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 158, 163, 164, 166 and 167.  The type location is in MLRA 166 on Molokai Island. On Maui, most of this Mapunit is 158, 163 and 166. On Oahu, most of this 158, 163, 166, 167. On Lanai, most of this Map unit is mapped in MLRA 166. There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. Exist the possibility that the MLRA boundaries will be redefined according to SDJR projects outcomes. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 , 163, 166 and 167 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures. 

There is not laboratory data for Jaucas component. It is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

MLRA 163 - Jaucas sand, 0 to 15 percent slopes

Introduction

Jaucas series consists of very deep, excessively drained, calcareous, sandy soils formed along the coast on from coral and sea shells. Typically, these soils have pale brown sand surface layers about 13 inches thick. The underlying layer to a depth of 60 inches or more is very pale brown sand. The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout the profile. Permeability is rapid, and runoff is very slow to slow.

Spatial Distribution

This map unit covers 888 acres in Maui and Oahu County and was originally mapped as Jaucas sand, saline 0 to 12 percent slopes. This map unit is found in MLRA 158 Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes, MLRA 163 Alluvial Fans and Costal Plains and MLRA 167 Humid Oxidic Soils on Low and Intermediate Rolling Mountain Slopes. 

Minor Components

No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit. 

Plan 

The 2015 project: MLRA 163 - Jaucas sand,saline 0 to 12 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for Jaucas sand,saline 0 to 12 percent slopes from 2 different national mapunit symbols. No minor components will be assigned during this SDJR project. The table below summarizes the mapunits and survey areas for the 2015 SDJR project.

Future Projects

This map unit should be investigated to confirm component composition. It is recommended to create a future MLRA project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 163 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

There is no Ecological Site information for Maui and Oahu. Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group across the MLRA 163. 

The Jaucas map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 158, 163,  and 167.  The type location is in MLRA 166 on Molokai Island. On Maui, most of this Mapunit is 158 and 163. On Oahu, most of this  163 and 167. There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. Exist the possibility that the MLRA boundaries will be redefined according to SDJR projects outcomes. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 , 163 and 167 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures. 

There is not laboratory data for Jaucas component. It is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD is the same of the OSD.  The descriptions are from 1972.  The OSD need to be brought to current description standards, as well as the TUD. The current location needs to be reviewed and, possibly, the type location will have to be relocated. The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Molokai Island of Hawaii. 

The parental material is alluvium and sand beach from Igneous rock and Calcareous deposition. 

In Molokai and Maui, the Kealia silt loam map unit is on salt marshes and tidal flats of the coastal plain. 

The mean annual rainfall ranges from 13 to 41 inches (337 to 1035 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F (23 to 25 degrees C). Elevation ranges from 0 to 259 feet (0 to 79 meters).

Future project:

Most of the acres of this Map unit occur in the MLRA 166.  A small portion of this map unit occur in MLRA 164 boundary. The map unit delineation should be examined across the MLRA boundary. 

Currently, there is no KSSL data for the Kealia series. Future projects are needed to collect soil sample, transect data and lab data in order to have more representative data of Kealia series. This information will be useful to determine: particle size, Ksat and rock fragment data.

MLRA 157 - Keawakapu extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 25 percent slopes

Introduction
The soil in this map unit occurs on gently sloping to moderately steep on Haleakala volcano slope on the Islands of Maui, Hawaii. It developed in volcanic ash over aa lava flow. These soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat.
The Mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 403 to 557 millimeters (16 to 22 inches). The Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) ranges from 16 to 25 degrees C. (61 to 77 degrees F). The mean annual soil temperature (MAST) is 25 degrees C. (77 degrees F.).  The difference between the mean summer and winter temperature is less than 6 degrees C. Elevation ranges from 113 to 345 meters (371 to 1,132 feet). 
The Keawakapu, extremely stony component makes up 75 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. This component is on islands, mountain slopes. The parent material consists of volcanic ash derived from volcanic rock and/or residuum weathered from aa lava. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is very low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very low. Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 1 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 5, 042 acres and was originally mapped - Keawakapu extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 25 percent slopes. On the Islands of Maui, Hawaii. 
Most of this map unit is mapped in MLRA 157 Arid and Semiarid Low Mountain Slopes (4,862 acres). However, this map unit is also mapped in MLRA 158 Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes (168 acres).

Minor Components
The minor components were assigned from the Soil Survey manuscript.
Kamaole   10%
Oanapuka  10%
Makena     5% 

Plan 
The 2017 project: MLRA 166 - Island of Maui, HI; MLRA and Data Map Unit correlation on Haleakala Shield Volcano, will update and Assign Data map units in MLRA 166 on West Maui Mt. and Haleakala shield volcano. 

Future Projects:
Minor components  
The minor components were captured from the Soil Survey manuscript but we are lacking data for composition. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 157 to update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Map unit composition 
Base on the published manuscript and aerial photo interpretation, there are some area of this map unit that are urban. This area needs to be investigated in order to determine if it may be a minor component for this map unit. 

Major component type location 
The current type location for the major component Keawakapu showed that this component is mapped in mapunit where this component is not a major component. The TUD and OSD are the same. However, the OSD and TUD have different type location and both are out of Keawakapu map unit.
	The OSD have the following coordinated: 20 degrees 43' 12"" north latitude and 156 degrees 25' 58"" west longitude; this location is inside of the MU: Makena loam, stony complex, 3 to 15 percent slopes. This map unit does not have minor component.
	The TUD have the following coordinated: 20 degrees 48' 12"" north latitude and 156 degrees 25' 58"" west longitude; this location is inside of the MU Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes. This map unit does not have minor component.
Therefore we recommend to set a new location for the OSD of Keawakapu inside of a Map unit where this soil is a Major component.

Slope phase
According with the manuscript, this map unit should has a slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent slope. However, based on the MUsum report, and ArcMap evaluation, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 4 to 16 percent slope on Maui Island.  These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

MLRA boundary
On Maui, This map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA-157; MLRA-158). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA-157 and  MLRA-158 will have to be re-correlated to another map unit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures.

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Keawakapu component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

Ecological Site
There is no Ecological Site information for Island Maui, Hawaii. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be performed to determine an Ecological Site ID, across the MLRA 157 and 157.

MLRA 158  Lahaina silty clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes 

Introduction
The soils in this map unit consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in  residuum weathered from basic igneous rock. Lahaina soils are on low elevation, mountain slopes and have slopes of 3 to 7 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 762 millimeters (30 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.) Elevation ranges from 3 to 457 meters (10 to 1,500 feet).

The Lahaina component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. This component is on intermediate uplands. The parent material consists of alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 3 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3e. Irrigated land capability classification is 3e This soil does not meet hydric criteria.

Introduction
The soils in this map unit consist of deep and very deep, well drained soils consisting of organic material over fragmental `a`a lava substrata at a shallow depth. Malama soils are on low elevation, windward mountain slopes of Kilauea and Haleakala shield volcanoes. Mean annual rainfall is about 2,384 millimeters (94 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).

The Malama, extremely stony component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 20 percent. This component is on aa lava flows on shield volcanoes on islands. The parent material consists of organic material over aa lava. Depth to a root restrictive layer, bedrock, lithic, is 40 to 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very low. Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 55 percent. Below this thin organic horizon the organic matter content is about 10 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 7s. Irrigated land capability classification is 7s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. 

Minor components:
Lava flows, `a`a - 10%

Spatial distribution
Overall, this map unit covers 3,212 acres and was originally mapped as Malama extremely stony muck, 3 to 25 percent slopes, on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. This map unit was mapped in MLRA 166 - Very Stony Land and Rock Land but will be updated to MLRA 159A - Humid and very humid volcanic ash soils on low and intermediate mountain slopes.

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 5434 acres and was originally mapped as Molokai silty clay loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes on Island of Lanai, Island of Molokai, Island of Maui and Island of Oahu, Hawaii. This map unit is found in MLRA 158 Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes.

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit.

Plan 
The 2016 project: SDJR - MLRA 158,166 - Molokai silty clay loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for 158 - Molokai silty clay loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes from 4 different national mapunit symbols.

Future Projects:

Minor component  
There are no minor components associated to this map unit composition. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future SDJR project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Component classification 
Molokai soil series was established in Island of Molokai, Hawaii in 1972.  The Soil Series is also mapped in Island of Lanai, Island of Maui and Island of Oahu, Hawaii. We found a considerable issue when we reviewed the taxonomic classification of Molokai component. This series was originally classified as Clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Torrox (1972). The current OSD describes Molokai as Very-fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic (2000). NSSC Lab data from the sampling performed in Molokai does not supported the classification of the soil as an Oxisols.  
There are nine additional pedons in NASIS for Molokai series. However, those pedons have four different taxonomic classification. None of those classifications are similar to the Molokai OSD Classification. 
Due to the inconsistency of the information and the lack of documentation or existing legacy documents for the MLRA MU, a KSSL sampling should be completed in order to gather more data and support the Molokai classification in the Hawaii Islands.
MLRA Delineation
This map unit is currently mapped in MLRA 158. However, there are few map units polygons crossing MLRA 166 (12 acres) and MLRA 163 (8 acres). These polygons should be evaluated in order to find if they are in concurrence with the concept of the mapunit. 

OSD and Lab Sampling
There seems to be sufficient documentation in NASIS, however the documentation on the NSSC Laboratory data for the Molokai series is incomplete or does not support the OSD taxonomic classification
 Therefore we support a future project to address those issues. Completion of this project will help to better identify a soil-landscape relationship found extensively throughout MLRA 158. Spatial and tabular data available to users will be updated. 

Ecological Site
There is no Ecological Site information for Island of Lanai, Island of Molokai, Island of Maui and Island of Oahu, Hawaii
Consequently we have recommended that a future project should be performed to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands soils across the MLRA 158.

Due to the inconsistency of the information and the lack of documentation or existing legacy documents for the MLRA MU, a KSSL sampling should be completed in order to gather more data and support the Molokai classification in the Hawaii Islands.

MLRA Delineation
This map unit is currently mapped in MLRA 158 (18,318 acres). However, there are few map units polygons crossing MLRA 163 (256 acres), MLRA 165 (201 acres) and MLRA 166 (1,094). These polygons should be evaluated in order to find if they are in concurrence with the concept of the mapunit. 

Landform and Slope 
This map unit is mapped in the upland positions. There are few map units in the backslope and summit areas that need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units. The slope range is from 3 to 7 percent. However, based on ArcMap, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The majority of these mapunits are in a range of 0 to 3 percent slopes.   These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

OSD and Lab Sampling
There seems to be sufficient documentation in NASIS, however the documentation on the NSSC Laboratory data for the Molokai series is incomplete or does not support the OSD taxonomic classification
 Therefore we support a future project to address those issues. Completion of this project will help to better identify a soil-landscape relationship found extensively throughout MLRA 158. Spatial and tabular data available to users will be updated.

Minor Components
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit.

Plan 

The 2016 project: SDJR - MLRA 158,166 - Molokai silty clay loam, 7 to 15 percent slopes, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for 158 -  Molokai silty clay loam, 7 to 15 percent slopes from 4 different national mapunit symbols. The table below summarizes the mapunits and survey areas for the 2016 SDJR project.

Minor component  
There are no minor components associated to this map unit composition. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future SDJR project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Component classification 
Molokai soil series was established in Island of Molokai, Hawaii in 1972.  The Soil Series is also mapped in Island of Lanai, Island of Maui and Island of Oahu, Hawaii. We found a considerable issue when we reviewed the taxonomic classification of Molokai component. This series was originally classified as Clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Torrox (1972). The current OSD describes Molokai as Very-fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic (2000). NSSC Lab data from the sampling performed in Molokai does not supported the classification of the soil as an Oxisols.  
There are nine additional pedons in NASIS for Molokai series. However, those pedons have four different taxonomic classification. None of those classifications are similar to the Molokai OSD Classification. 
Due to the inconsistency of the information and the lack of documentation or existing legacy documents for the MLRA MU, a KSSL sampling should be completed in order to gather more data and support the Molokai classification in the Hawaii Islands.
MLRA Delineation


This map unit is currently mapped in MLRA 158 (4473 acres). However, there are few map units polygons crossing MLRA 163 (348 acres), MLRA 165 (122 acres) and MLRA 166 (523). These polygons should be evaluated in order to find if they are in concurrence with the concept of the mapunit. 
Landform and Slope 
This map unit is mapped in the upland positions. There are few map units in the backslope and summit areas that need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units. The slope range is from 7 to 15 percent. However, based on ArcMap, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The majority of these mapunits are in a range of 0 to 3 percent slopes. These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.
OSD and Lab Sampling
There seems to be sufficient documentation in NASIS, however the documentation on the NSSC Laboratory data for the Molokai series is incomplete or does not support the OSD taxonomic classification
 Therefore we support a future project to address those issues. Completion of this project will help to better identify a soil-landscape relationship found extensively throughout MLRA 158. Spatial and tabular data available to users will be updated. 

Ecological Site
There is no Ecological Site information for Island of Lanai, Island of Molokai, Island of Maui and Island of Oahu, Hawaii
Consequently we have recommended that a future project should be performed to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands soils across the MLRA 158.

Future Projects:

Major Component classification
Oanapuka soil series was established in the Island of Maui, Hawaii in 1971.  The TUD, from Maui Island, is the same as the OSD. This series was originally classified as Medial, isohyperthermic Ustollic Eutrandepts (1971). The current OSD describes Oanapuka as Medial, amorphic, isohyperthermic Typic Vitritorrands (2001). The OSD was evaluated and populated in NASIS. The OSD is the only pedon in NASIS. Also, there is no lab data for Oanapuka. 

The OSD pedons descriptions do not support the current OSD classification (grate group Vitritorrands).The great groups Vitritorrands are Torrands that have, on air-dried samples, a 1500 kPa water retention of less than 15 percent throughout 60  Percent or more of the thickness. Also , to use the Vitric  suffix the soil must have more that 30 %  of the fine-earth fraction in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction (course texture, like ash [no smeary]), and have (by grain count)  more that 30 %  fraction consisting of volcanic glass, glass aggregates, glass-coated grains, and other vitric volcanoclastic.  Moreover, the minerology might be glassy.

The OSD pedon have a Medial particle size family. Soils with Medial particle size use medial textural modifier (no all the time). The medial modifier is determined on the smeariness failure class (weakly smeary). Most of the textures are finer than fine sandy loam (silt loam, silty clay loam).  It is difficult to feel smeariness in sandy texture Also, most of the minerology are amorphic, ferrihidritic or mixed.

However, due to the inconsistencies in the information and the lack of documentation or existing legacy documents for the MLRA MU, a KSSL sampling should be completed in order to gather more data and support the Oanapuka classification in the Hawaii Islands.


Minor components  
The minor components were captured from the Soil Survey manuscript but we are lacking data for composition. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 157 to update the MLRA MU and DMU.  

Map Unit composition
Base on the published manuscript and aerial photo interpretation, there are some area of this map unit that are rock outcrop. This area needs to be investigated in order to determine if it may be a minor component for this map unit.

Legend
This map unit was just wrongly designated to MLRA 166.  The Legend Area overlap needs to be change for MLRA 157.

MLRA boundary
On Maui, This map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA-157; MLRA-160). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA-157 and  MLRA-160 will have to be re-correlated to another map unit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures.

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Oanapuka component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

Ecological Site
There is no Ecological Site information for Island Maui, Hawaii. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be performed to determine an Ecological Site ID, across the MLRA 157 and 160.

This component is in the F160XY503HI Isothermic Forest ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 6s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 3 percent. 

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 13,522 acres and was originally mapped as Puu Pa very stony silt loam, 7 to 40 percent slopes on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. This map unit is mapped in MLRA 157 - Arid and semiarid low and intermediate mountain slopes.

Minor Components
10 percent - Lava flows, `a`a

Plan 
The 2017 project: MLRA 166 - Island of Maui, HI; MLRA and Data Map Unit correlation on Haleakala Shield Volcano, will update and Assign Data map units in MLRA 166 Haleakala shield volcano.

Future Projects:
Therefore we recommend a future sampling project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.
The map unit delineation needs to be spatially updated. The map unit extends into the isohyperthermic and into the isomesic. The mapping of this dmu should be updated so that the unit occurs only in the isothermic area.

Major component classification
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory to confirm the taxonomy classification of Kaupo.  At this time we have recommended to utilize the existing data from other sites to estimate the classification but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

Minor components  
Lava flows, `a`a were assigned as a minor component with 2017 update project. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 157 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Kaupo component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

MLRA boundary
Puu Pa very stony medial silt loam, 15 to 50 percent slopes map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 160 on the Island of Maui, Hawaii.

Future Project

Minor components
The minor component came from the historical non-MLRA map units.  However, due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data documents for the MLRA MU  we recommended creating a future project from SDJR to compile more field data to support the MU composition percent  across the entire MLRA 166 and update the MLRA MU and DMU if necessary. At this time we have recommended to utilize the existing data but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Pulehu Series. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation. 

OSD
The current location needs to be reviewed and, possibly, the type location will have to be relocated.

MLRA boundary 
The Pulehu map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 158, 163, 164, 165 and 166. The type location is in MLRA 158 on Oahu Island. However most of the acres of this map unit occur on MLRA 163. There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. Exist the possibility that the MLRA boundaries will be redefined according to SDJR projects outcomes and this map unit will be on MLRA 163. 

Component Month
There are two different frequencies of flooding for this component. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future SDJR project to address this situation.

Component crop
There is no component crop yield data for this MU.  Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine the crop yield data for Island of Lanai, Island of Maui, Island of Molokai and Island of Oahu across the MLRA 163.

Ecological Site 
There is no Ecological Site information for Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group across the MLRA 163.

MLRA 164 - Typic Endoaquepts mucky silt loam,  1 to 15 percent slopes

Introduction
This map unit consists of deep, poorly drained soils that are periodically flooded by irrigation in order to grow crops that thrive in water. These soils are used for production of taro, rice, and watercress on flooded paddies.  These soils are formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary deposit.The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1376 to 4242 millimeters (54 to 167 inches). Elevation ranges from 2 to 150 meters (7 to 492 feet).

The Typic Endoaquepts component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. This component is on islands, valley floors. The parent material consists of mucky silt loam and silty clay alluvium derived from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is frequently flooded. It is frequently ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 15 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 4w. Irrigated land capability classification is 4w. This soil meets hydric criteria.     

This map unit previously had slope phase of 0 to 2 percent; but, after analysis of 10m DEM, the slopes were changed to 1 to 15 percent on the Island of Maui.

Geomorphic Description
Landscape: Islands (representative)
Landform: valley floors (representative); Alluvial fan, flood plains, Costal plains and shore complexes.

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 162 acres. This map unit was originally mapped as Tropaquepts on the Island of Maui (162 acres). This map unit is in MLRA 164 - Humid and very humid steep and very steep mountain slopes.

Minor components:
No minor components were assigned to this particular map unit because field data collected did not identify any minor components on the particular landform and map unit during the initial soil survey. There may be minor components that have not been identified in some delineations.

Plan 
The SDJR - MLRA 164,? - Tropaquepts, will create 1 new national mapunit symbol, 1 new map unit and 1 new data map unit for Typic Endoaquepts, 1 to 15 percent slopes from 1  national mapunit symbols. The table below summarizes the map unit and survey areas for the 2017 SDJR project.

Future Project

Major Component classification
The major component of this map unit Tropaquepts had an obsolete classification. The great group Tropaquepts is no longer used in the Key of Soil Taxonomy. Based on limited documentation provide on the manuscript and NASIS, this component can qualify as an Endoquepts great group. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of  documentation.

Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data documents for the MLRA MU we recommended creating a future project from SDJR to compile more field data to support the MU composition percent across the entire MLRA 158, MLRA 163 MLRA , MLRA 164, MLRA 167 and update the MLRA MU and DMU if necessary. At this time we have recommended to utilize the existing data but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

OSD Typical Pedon and Location
There is no profile description and type location of Typic Endoaquepts. At this time we have recommended to utilize the existing data from other sites to estimate the classification but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.


Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Typic Endoaquepts component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

MLRA boundary
This Map unit is currently mapped across diferent MLRAs boundary on the Island of Oahu and Maui, Hawaii.On Island of Maui, this map unit is mapped in MLRA 163 (29 acres), MLRA 164 (132 acres). On island of Oahu, this map unit is mapped in MLRA 159 (60 acres), MLRA (263 acres) and MLRA 167 (265 acres). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158, MLRA 163, MLRA 164 and MLRA 167 will have to be re-correlated to another map unit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures.

Component crop
There is no component crop yield data for this MU.  Therefore we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine the crop yield data for Island of Maui, and Island of Oahu across the MLRAs

Waiakoa extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 25 percent slopes, eroded, MLRA 157

Introduction

The soil in this map unit consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Mean annual rainfall is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F). Elevation for this map unit ranges from 5 to 140 meter (16 to 459 feet). These soils are used for pasture. In the past, some areas were used for irrigated sugarcane.  The natural vegetation is mainly buffelgrass (Pennisetum cilliare), Spanish needle (Bidens pilosa), uhaloa (Waltheria indica) and zinnia (Zinnia pauciflora).

The Waiakoa, extremely stony, eroded component makes up 100 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. This component is on ash fields on Haleakala shield volcano. The parent material consists of volcanic ash and/or residuum weathered from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer, bedrock, lithic, is 31 to 35 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 7s.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.   

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 14,221 acres and was originally mapped as Waiakoa extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 25 percent slopes, eroded on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. This map unit is mapped in MLRA 157 - Arid and semiarid low and intermediate mountain slopes.

Minor Components
There are no minor components

Plan 
The 2017 project: MLRA 166 - Island of Maui, HI; MLRA and Data Map Unit correlation on Haleakala Shield Volcano, will update and Assign Data map units in MLRA 166 Haleakala shield volcano.

Future Projects:
we recommend a future sampling project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

The map unit delineation needs to be spatially updated. The map unit maty extend into higher elevations based on investigation of soil temperature. The mapping of this dmu should be updated so that the unit occurs in the higher elevation areas on South slope of Haleakala.

Major component classification
Pedon needs to be collected for representative component pedon. There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory to confirm the taxonomy classification of Kaupo.  At this time we have recommended to utilize the existing data from other sites to estimate the classification but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

Minor components  
Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 157 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Kaupo component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

MLRA boundary
Waiakoa extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 25 percent slopes, eroded map unit is currently mapped across  MLRA 157 on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The map unit maty extend into higher elevations based on investigation of soil temperature. The mapping of this dmu may need to be updated so that the unit occurs in the higher elevation areas on South slope of Haleakala. This would affectively increase the area of MLRA 157 on Haleakala.

MLRA 158 - Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes

This map unit covers 2,053 acres (ArMap). The map unit was originally mapped as Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes on Island of Maui, Hawaii (HI980). This map unit is currently mapped across MLRA 158 (Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes),  and MLRA 163 (Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains) in Maui. 

A review of series concepts in the manuscripts was compared to the most current OSD. The TUD description from Island of Maui is the same as the current OSD. However, both have different taxonomic classification. The TUD description (Fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Aridic Haplustolls) is from 1965. However, the OSD was updated on 1978 (Fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Torroxic Haplustolls).  The OSD classification was evaluated with the current version of Key of taxonomy and using the laboratory data of this pedon ( Pedon ID  S1965HI009020). Based on the Lab data , the particle size family need to be change from Fine to Fine-Loamy. 

At this moment we are not going to make any change to the taxonomy until we get additional pedon descriptions and lab data. 
The series concept has not changed from the time of the original correlation and mapping. The series is set up for Island of Maui.

MLRA 158 - Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes 

Introduction
This map unit is formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock. The mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 395 to 540 millimeters (16 to 21 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 23 to 26 degrees C. (73 to 79 degrees F.). Elevation ranges from 65 to 340 meters (213 to 1115 feet).

The Waiakoa component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 7 percent. This component is on ash fields on Haleakala shield volcano. The parent material consists of volcanic ash over residuum weathered from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer, bedrock, lithic, is 25 to 37 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 4s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria.

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 2,053 acres and was originally mapped as Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes (hqc5) on the Island of Maui (HI980).  Most of this map unit is mapped in MLRA 158 - Semiarid and Subhumid Low Mountain Slopes (1,888 acres). However, this map unit is also mapped in and MLRA 163 -Alluvial Fans and Coastal Plains (165 acres). MLRA 158 - Waiakoa very stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes (2yyrl) will replace the original map unit. 

Future Projects

Minor components
There are some problem regarding with the map unit composition due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data documents for this Map Unit. However, some inclusions were capture from the Soil Survey publications across the MLRA 158, but we are lacking the percentages.

Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 158 and 163 and update the MLRA MU and DMU. At this time, we have recommended to utilize the existing data, but additional data should be collected and analyzed in order to develop better interpretations.

Slope Phase
According with the manuscript this map unit should has a slope ranges from 3 to 7 percent slopes. However, based on the MUsum report and Arcmap evaluation, there are few map units polygons out of this range of slope. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 10 percent slope on Maui Island.  These polygons need to be evaluated to see if they are the same as the rest of the map units.

MLRA boundary
On Maui, this map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA 158 -1,888 acres and MLRA 163-165 acres). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA 158 and MLRA 163 will have to be re-correlated to another mapunit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures. 

Delineation 
This map unit is formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock and mapped in hillslope. However, there are few map unit polygons mapped in Alluvium material (sand and gravel) in the isthmus (low elevation). 

Also, there are some delineation/polygons that have drainages or gully inside the delineation that could be part of minor component. 

In addition, based on our ArcMap evaluation, there are few map unit polygons have some surface erosion (looks like barren land) and its hard to see if any rock fragment present is there.   
 
Therefore, we recommended to create a future project to evaluate this delineation in order to find fill the concept of the map unit, soil interpretations, and landforms.

Lab data 
There are three pedons in the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Soil Characterization Database.  This pedons are populated in NASIS.  The Pedon ID S1965HI009020, is the same as the OSD. The Pedon 83HI009001   and S1965HI009019 have incomplete laboratory data. Therefore, it is recommended a future MLRA project be set up to address the lack of characterization data.

Ecological site
There is no Ecological Site information for Maui. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be carry out to determine an Ecological Site ID, Name and group for the Waiakoa soils across the MLRA 163 and MLRA 158.

Waiakoa extremely stony silty clay loam, 3 to 7 percent slopes map unit is currently mapped across  MLRA 157 on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The map unit maty extend into higher elevations based on investigation of soil temperature. The mapping of this dmu may need to be updated so that the unit occurs in the higher elevation areas on South slope of Haleakala. This would affectively increase the area of MLRA 157 on Haleakala.

MLRA 157 - Wainee extremely stony silty clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes

Introduction
The soil in this map unit occurs on alluvial fans on the Islands of Maui, Hawaii. It developed in alluvium derived from weathered basic igneous rock. These soils are used for pasture and homesites. The annual vegetation is fingergrass , kiawe, and uhaloa.
The Mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 381 to 608 millimeters (15 to 24 inches). The Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) ranges from 16 to 25 degrees C. (61 to 77 degrees F). The mean annual soil temperature (MAST) is 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.).  The difference between the mean summer and winter temperature is less than 6 degrees C. Elevation ranges from 18 to 187 meters (59 to 614 feet). 

The Wainee, extremely stony component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 7 to 15 percent. This component is on alluvial fans, islands. The parent material consists of alluvium derived from volcanic rock. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 6s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 1 percent.  

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 1,424 acres and was originally mapped Wainee extremely stony silty clay, 7 to 15 percent slopes on the Islands of Maui, Hawaii. 
Most of this map unit is mapped in MLRA 157 Arid and Semiarid Low Mountain Slopes (1,024 acres). However, this map unit is also mapped in MLRA 166 Very stony Land and Rock Land (400 acres).

Minor Components
The minor components were assigned from the Soil Survey manuscript.

Future Projects:

Minor components  
The minor components were captured from the Soil Survey manuscript but we are lacking data for composition. Due to the lack of documentation or existing legacy data for the MLRA MU we recommended to create a future project to compile the MU composition across the entire MLRA 157 to update the MLRA MU and DMU. 

Map unit composition 
Base on the published manuscript and aerial photo interpretation, there are some area of this map unit that are rock outcrop.  This area needs to be investigated in order to determine if it may be a minor component for this map unit. 

Major component classification 
There is no lab data to confirm the minerology parasesquic. Also, this soil meet the color criteria for the  mollic epipedon but the pH is a little high and there is no lab data to verify the percentage of base saturation. 

MLRA boundary
On Maui, This map unit is currently mapped across 2 different MLRAs (MLRA-157; MLRA-166). There is a need to investigate and determine if this soil needs to be split along MLRA lines based on MLRA definition. If split, then the map unit in MLRA-157 and  MLRA-166 will have to be re-correlated to another map unit according to MLRAs definitions and MO standard procedures.

Lab data
There is no documentation in the NCSS Laboratory for the Wainee component. Therefore we recommend a future project to address the lack of laboratory data and related documentation.

Ecological Site
There is no Ecological Site information for Island Maui, Hawaii. Therefore, we have recommended that a future project should be performed to determine an Ecological Site ID, across the MLRA 157 and 166.

MLRA 164  Amalu peat, 3 to 20 perecent slopes 

Introduction
The soils in this map unit consist of shallow, poorly drained soils that formed in organic matter over basic volcanic ash and tropospheric dust over residuum weathered from basalt. Amalu soils are on ash fields and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 3000 millimeters (118 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F). 

The Amalu component makes up 90 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 3 to 20 percent. This component is on ash fields on shield volcanoes on islands. The parent material consists of organic material over volcanic ash over residuum weathered from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer, placic, is 16 to 23 inches (depth from the mineral surface is 11 to 8 inches). The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 4 inches during January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 95 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 7w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.   

Spatial Distribution
This map unit covers 6,217 acres in Maui county. It was originally mapped as Amalu peat silty clay, 3 to 20 perecent slopes on the Islands of Maui (HI980) and Molokai (HI950).  This map unit is found in MLRA 164.

Minor Components
Minor components that were identified in the manuscript will be assigned to this new map unit. These are the Honomanu and Olokui components.

Plan 
The 2015 project: SDJR - MLRA 166, ?  Amalu peaty silty clay, 3 to 20 perecent slopes will create 1 new national mapunit symbol (2w02v), 1 new map units and 1 new data map unit for Amalu  peat, 3 to 20 perecent slopes from 2 different national mapunit symbols. MLRA 164  Amalu peat, 3 to 20 perecent slopes (2w02v) will be added to the Islands of Maui (HI980) and Molokai (HI950) legends.  Minor components will be assigned during this SDJR project.
