58|"Yields of Irrigated Crops (Component)"|"cocropyld"|"irryield_r"|"Float"||2|"These are the estimated average yields per acre that can be expected of selected irrigated crops under a high level of management. In any given year, yields may be higher or lower than those indicated because of variations in rainfall and other climatic factors. It is assumed that the irrigation system is adapted to the soils and to the crops grown, that good-quality irrigation water is uniformly applied as needed, and that tillage is kept to a minimum.

In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

The estimated yields reflect the productive capacity of each soil for the selected crop. Yields are likely to increase as new production technology is developed.

An index can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time.  Ratings range from 0 to 100.  The higher numbers indicate higher production potential.

The CPI ratings do not take into account climatic factors, such as the differences in precipitation or growing degree days across Minnesota.  The ratings are based on physical and chemical properties of the soils and on such hazards and flooding and ponding.  Available water capacity, reaction (pH), slopes, soil moisture status, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter content, salinity, and surface fragments are the major properties evaluated when CPI ratings are generated.  The soil properties selected are those that are important for the production of corn.

All map units in Minnesota were initially evaluated using the Cropland Productivity rule in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).  They were assigned a value using an overall CPI based on the combined properties and characteristics of the map unit as a whole, and the values were adjusted based on tacit knowledge of local experts.  An individual map unit (for example, Canisteo clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes) will have the same CPI value wherever that map unit occurs throughout the state.

When the soils are rated, the following assumptions are made:  a) adequate management, b) no irrigation, c) artificial drainage where required, d) no land leveling or terracing, and e) no climatic factors considered. 

The map unit CPI was used to update the map unit crop yields for corn and soybeans.

46|"Corrosion of Steel"|"component"|"corsteel"|"Choice"|254||"""Risk of corrosion"" pertains to potential soil-induced electrochemical or chemical action that corrodes or weakens uncoated steel. The rate of corrosion of uncoated steel is related to such factors as soil moisture, particle-size distribution, acidity, and electrical conductivity of the soil.

526|"Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT)"|"mapunit"|"vtsepticsyscl"|"Choice"|254||"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
     •   	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent. The ratings in this interpretation do not take into consideration some site factors that can affect the placement of septic systems, such as wellhead and source protection areas, isolation distances, and the size of the parcel.
This interpretation is intended for general planning purposes only and is not intended to replace or supersede the need for an onsite soil investigation. These ratings apply only to land within the State of Vermont."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"SBRWDR"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Ia"" label=""Ia"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ib"" label=""Ib"" order=""2""><Color red=""44"" green=""188"" blue=""20"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ic"" label=""Ic"" order=""3""><Color red=""27"" green=""118"" blue=""12"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Id"" label=""Id"" order=""4""><Color red=""187"" green=""239"" blue=""196"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIa"" label=""IIa"" order=""5""><Color red=""158"" green=""145"" blue=""50"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIb"" label=""IIb"" order=""6""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""176"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIc"" label=""IIc"" order=""7""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IId"" label=""IId"" order=""8""><Color red=""166"" green=""197"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIe"" label=""IIe"" order=""9""><Color red=""108"" green=""99"" blue=""34"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIf"" label=""IIf"" order=""10""><Color red=""214"" green=""194"" blue=""158"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIg"" label=""IIg"" order=""11""><Color red=""178"" green=""142"" blue=""76"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIh"" label=""IIh"" order=""12""><Color red=""175"" green=""113"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIa"" label=""IIIa"" order=""13""><Color red=""245"" green=""153"" blue=""77"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIb"" label=""IIIb"" order=""14""><Color red=""232"" green=""113"" blue=""14"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIc"" label=""IIIc"" order=""15""><Color red=""189"" green=""92"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIId"" label=""IIId"" order=""16""><Color red=""249"" green=""208"" blue=""153"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIe"" label=""IIIe"" order=""17""><Color red=""246"" green=""99"" blue=""8"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIf"" label=""IIIf"" order=""18""><Color red=""251"" green=""180"" blue=""137"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIg"" label=""IIIg"" order=""19""><Color red=""207"" green=""136"" blue=""117"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVa"" label=""IVa"" order=""20""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVb"" label=""IVb"" order=""21""><Color red=""243"" green=""150"" blue=""141"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVc"" label=""IVc"" order=""22""><Color red=""190"" green=""93"" blue=""62"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVd"" label=""IVd"" order=""23""><Color red=""226"" green=""96"" blue=""96"" /></Labels><Labels value=""V"" label=""V"" order=""24""><Color red=""220"" green=""48"" blue=""220"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|12/29/2011 07:52:58|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
471|"Soil Taxonomy Classification"|"component"|"taxclname"|"String"|120||"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use. The classes are defined as follows:

Class 1 soils have few limitations that restrict their use.

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels-capability class, subclass, and unit. Only class and subclass are included in this data set.

Capability subclasses are soil groups within one capability class. They are designated by adding a small letter, ""e,"" ""w,"" ""s,"" or ""c,"" to the class numeral, for example, 2e. The letter ""e"" shows that the main hazard is the risk of erosion unless close-growing plant cover is maintained; ""w"" shows that water in or on the soil interferes with plant growth or cultivation (in some soils the wetness can be partly corrected by artificial drainage); ""s"" shows that the soil is limited mainly because it is shallow, droughty, or stony; and ""c,"" used in only some parts of the United States, shows that the chief limitation is climate that is very cold or very dry.

In class 1 there are no subclasses because the soils of this class have few limitations.

32|"Irrigated Capability Subclass"|"component"|"irrcapscl"|"Choice"|254||"Land capability classification shows, in a general way, the suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops. Crops that require special management are excluded. The soils are grouped according to their limitations for field crops, the risk of damage if they are used for crops, and the way they respond to management. The criteria used in grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible but unlikely major reclamation projects. Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, or for engineering purposes.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels-capability class, subclass, and unit. Only class and subclass are included in this data set.

Capability subclasses are soil groups within one capability class. They are designated by adding a small letter, ""e,"" ""w,"" ""s,"" or ""c,"" to the class numeral, for example, 2e. The letter ""e"" shows that the main hazard is the risk of erosion unless close-growing plant cover is maintained; ""w"" shows that water in or on the soil interferes with plant growth or cultivation (in some soils the wetness can be partly corrected by artificial drainage); ""s"" shows that the soil is limited mainly because it is shallow, droughty, or stony; and ""c,"" used in only some parts of the United States, shows that the chief limitation is climate that is very cold or very dry.

In class 1 there are no subclasses because the soils of this class have few limitations. Class 5 contains only the subclasses indicated by ""w,"" ""s,"" or ""c"" because the soils in class 5 are subject to little or no erosion. They have other limitations that restrict their use to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"IrrCpScls"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|8||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""8""><ColorRampType type=""0"" name=""Random""><Values min=""50"" max=""99"" /><Saturation min=""33"" max=""66"" /><Hue start=""0"" end=""360"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""e"" label=""Erosion"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""s"" label=""Soil limitation within the rooting zone"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""w"" label=""Excess water"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""c"" label=""Climate condition"" order=""4"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|05/30/2008 12:50:33|"Dominant Condition"||1|"Choice"
191|"Conservation Tree and Shrub Group"|"component"|"constreeshrubgrp"|"Choice"|254||"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"ConsTSG"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|7||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7"">

523|"NH Forest Soil Group"|"mapunit"|"nhiforsoigrp"|"Choice"|254||"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness. 

IIB--The soils in this group are poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is generally within 12 inches of the surface. Productivity is generally less than that of soils in the other groups. 

NC--The map units in this category either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG. Commonly, onsite visit would be required to evaluate the situation."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"NHFsg"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Group IA"" label=""Group IA"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""176"" blue=""80"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IB"" label=""Group IB"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IC"" label=""Group IC"" order=""3""><Color red=""255"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIA"" label=""Group IIA"" order=""4""><Color red=""153"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIB"" label=""Group IIB"" order=""5""><Color red=""255"" green=""204"" blue=""102"" /></Labels><Labels value=""NC"" label=""NC"" order=""6""><Color red=""255"" green=""175"" blue=""234"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|11/03/2011 10:24:20|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
16|"Hydric Rating by Map Unit"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating indicates the percentage of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

379|"Plasticity Index"|"chorizon"|"pi_r"|"Float"||1|"Plasticity index (PI) is one of the standard Atterberg limits used to indicate the plasticity characteristics of a soil. It is defined as the numerical difference between the liquid limit and plastic limit of the soil.  It is the range of water content in which a soil exhibits the characteristics of a plastic solid. 

The plastic limit is the water content that corresponds to an arbitrary limit between the plastic and semisolid states of a soil.  The liquid limit is the water content, on a percent by weight basis, of the soil (passing #40 sieve) at which the soil changes from a plastic to a liquid state.   

Soils that have a high plasticity index have a wide range of moisture content in which the soil performs as a plastic material. Highly and moderately plastic clays have large PI values.  Plasticity index is used in classifying soils in the Unified and AASHTO classification systems.

101|"Available Water Storage"|"chorizon"|"awc_r"|"Float"||2|"Available water storage (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants when the soil, inclusive of rock fragments, is at field capacity. It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and the wilting point, with corrections for salinity, rock fragments, and rooting depth. AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil layer, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water storage for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water storage), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

For the available water storage, when a weighted average of all component values is computed, percent composition is the weighting factor. "|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||0|1|0|1||1|||1|"AWS"||||||||1|"Depth Range"||||0|||"Weighted Sum"|0|0||0|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3"">

Temperature, texture, density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), content of organic matter, and depth to the water table are the most important factors considered in evaluating the potential for frost action. It is assumed that the soil is not insulated by vegetation or snow and is not artificially drained. Silty and highly structured, clayey soils that have a high water table in winter are the most susceptible to frost action. Well drained, very gravelly, or very sandy soils are the least susceptible. Frost heave and low soil strength during thawing cause damage to pavements and other rigid structures."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0|"potential_frost_action"|1|||1|"FrostAct"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""High"" label=""High"" order=""1""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Moderate"" label=""Moderate"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""170"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Low"" label=""Low"" order=""3""><Color red=""169"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""None"" label=""None"" order=""4""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|03/04/2007 08:15:59|"Dominant Condition"||1|"Choice"

These divisions are further subdivided into a total of 15 basic soil groups. The major soil divisions and basic soil groups are determined on the basis of estimated or measured values for grain-size distribution and Atterberg limits. ASTM D 2487 shows the criteria chart used for classifying soil in the Unified system and the 15 basic soil groups of the system and the plasticity chart for the Unified system.

The various groupings of this classification correlate in a general way with the engineering behavior of soils. This correlation provides a useful first step in any field or laboratory investigation for engineering purposes. It can serve to make some general interpretations relating to probable performance of the soil for engineering uses.

For each soil horizon in the database one or more Unified soil classifications may be listed.  One is marked as the representative or most commonly occurring.

Soils are assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from long-duration storms.

The soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). The groups are defined as follows:

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

If a soil is assigned to a dual hydrologic group (A/D, B/D, or C/D), the first letter is for drained areas and the second is for undrained areas.
