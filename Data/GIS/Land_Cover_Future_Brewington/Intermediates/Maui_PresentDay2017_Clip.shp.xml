The 2017 land-cover map is a modified version of the 2010 land-cover map included in the geospatial dataset titled "Mean annual water-budget components for the Island of Maui, Hawaii, for average climate conditions, 1978-2007 rainfall and 2010 land cover (version 2.0)" by Johnson (2017). The 2010 land-cover map was generated by intersecting (merging) multiple spatial datasets that characterize the spatial distribution of rainfall, cloud-water (or fog) interception, irrigation, reference evapotranspiration, direct runoff, soil type, and land cover. Land-cover designations in the 2010 land-cover map were derived mainly from the U.S. Geological Survey LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map (LANDFIRE.HI_110EVT, Refresh 2008) for the island of Maui. The 2017 land-cover map retains the merged structure of the 2010 land-cover map but includes modifications mainly related to agricultural land use since the release of the 2010 land-cover map. Modifications to the 2010 land-cover map included updating the land cover and vegetation designations, and the polygon boundaries in the 2010 land-cover map to reflect (1) the cessation of sugarcane cultivation by Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company in December 2016, and (2) the agricultural land-use information described in the Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline 2015 map by Melrose and others (2016). These modifications affected about 10 percent of the total area in the 2010 land-cover map. The 2017 land-cover map also distinguishes between (1) forested areas that are within the fog-interception zone, assumed to be at elevations of 2,000 feet and higher on Maui, and (2) forested areas that are below the fog-interception zone. The same distinction was included in the analysis of Johnson and others (2018) and in the spatial structure of the 2010 land-cover map, but was omitted from the land-cover names in the attribute table of the 2010 land-cover map.</abstract><purpose>This dataset was developed for use in a water-budget model that estimates groundwater recharge, fog drip, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and runoff.</purpose><supplinf>Version History 1.1 - The process to create version 1.0 of the 2017 land-cover map was modified for version 1.1. In version 1.0, the multi-part to single-part polygon conversion step was applied before the assignment of 2017 land-cover conditions and before the merging of small polygons (less than 0.1 acre in area) with adjacent large polygons. In version 1.1, the multi-part to single-part polygon conversion step was applied after the assignment of 2017 land-cover conditions and after the merging of small polygons with adjacent large polygons. This modification was done to eliminate unintended changes to land-cover conditions assigned to small polygons. In version 1.1, the land-cover conditions in the 2010 land-cover map (Johnson, 2017) were retained for small polygons, except where changes in assigned land-cover conditions were intended.

Version History 1.2 - The process for delineating the fog-interception zone for version 1.1 of the 2017 land-cover map was amended for version 1.2. In version 1.1, areas at elevations of 2,000 feet and greater were assumed to be in the fog-interception zone. Polygons representing areas with an elevation equal to or greater than 2,000 feet, the base of the fog-interception zone, with "Alien forest," "Native forest," and "Tree plantation" land-cover classifications were reassigned as "Alien forest, fog," Native forest, fog," and "Tree plantation, fog," respectively. Polygons representing areas below an elevation of 2,000 feet, with "Alien forest," "Native forest," and "Tree plantation" land-cover classifications were reassigned as "Alien forest, no fog," Native forest, no fog," and "Tree plantation, no fog," respectively. Johnson and others (2018) used the same elevation-based approach to delineate the fog-interception zone but excluded from the fog-interception zone a few small (less than 1 acre), scattered land pinnacles between elevations of 2,000 and 2,100 feet on west Maui. Consequently, in version 1.1 of the 2017 land-cover map, 15 of the roughly 68,000 polygons that were assigned one of the fog and forest land-cover designations were not actually in the fog-interception zone delineated by Johnson and others (2018). In version 1.2 of the 2017 land-cover map, all “fog” and “no fog” designations were assigned to be consistent with the fog-interception zone used by Johnson and others (2018).</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20080101</begdate><enddate>20170101</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-156.702355317</westbc><eastbc>-155.97393106</eastbc><northbc>21.032681547</northbc><southbc>20.56801608</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>USGS Thesaurus</themekt><themekey>land use and land cover</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>USGS information products</themekt><themekey>Land Use and Land Cover Map</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>Hawaii</placekey><placekey>Maui</placekey><placekey>Pacific islands</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None.</accconst><useconst>Users are advised to read the dataset's metadata thoroughly to understand appropriate use and data limitations.

The main operations in this process step included the following:

(1) Used the 100-ft contour map (State of Hawaii, 1997) to create a map defining the fog-interception zone. Areas at elevations of 2,000 feet and greater were assumed to be in the fog-interception zone and may contribute to fog interception, depending on land-cover conditions. Areas below an elevation of 2,000 ft were assumed to be below the fog-interception zone and have no fog interception. The fog-interception zone was also needed for PROCESS STEP 2, in which polygons with forest land-cover conditions were identified as being below or within the fog-interception zone;

(2) Merged the 2010 land-cover map (Johnson, 2017), 2015 agriculture map (Melrose and others, 2016), and the map of the fog-interception zone using the ArcGIS Union tool to create interim map 1;

(3) Added temporary fields to the attribute table of interim map 1 and assigned values for denoting the potential for fog interception, and the presence of septic systems and direct recharge sources such as reservoirs and cesspools. Polygons with mean annual septic-system leachate and mean annual direct recharge values in the 2010 land-cover map that were greater than zero were assumed to have septic systems and direct recharge sources;

(4) Created interim map 2 by clipping interim map 1 to the coastline depicted in the 2010 land-cover map to remove small merged areas from the 2015 agriculture map that extended beyond the boundaries of the 2010 land-cover map;

(5) Saved the new map as a geodatabase feature class and exported the attribute table to a comma-separated values (csv) file, hereinafter the Process Step 1 output.</procdesc><procdate>20171101</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>PROCESS STEP 2: Used a Python script developed in Jupyter Notebook (Python notebook) to assign 2017 land-cover conditions. The main operations in this process step included the following:

(1) Imported the output .csv file from Process Step 1 into a Python notebook;

(2) Assigned "Fallow/grassland" to all polygons with a "Sugar" land-cover classification in the 2015 agriculture map. This land-cover change was done to reflect the cessation of all sugarcane cultivation by Hawaiian Commercial &amp; Sugar Company in December 2016; 

(3) Assigned "Coffee," "Macadamia," "Pineapple," and "Taro" to all polygons with these same land-cover classifications in the 2015 agriculture map;

(4) Assigned "Diversified agriculture" to all polygons with "Banana," "Flowers/Foliage/Landscape," "Diversified Crop," and "Tropical Fruits" land-cover classifications in the 2015 agriculture map. The Hawaii water-budget model does not make a distinction for these four agricultural land covers. Instead, the model uses a "Diversified agriculture" land-cover classification to represent the cultivation of a variety of crops other than sugarcane, coffee, macadamia, pineapple, seed corn, and taro. Hence, a "Diversified agriculture" land-cover classification was used as a 2017 land-cover classification to reflect these four agricultural land covers;

(5) Assigned "Seed corn" to all polygons with a "Seed production" land-cover classification in the 2015 agriculture map. "Seed corn" was used as the land-cover classification for "Seed production" because seed corn was reported as being the primary seed crop grown in Hawaii (USDA-NASS, 2016);

(6) Assigned "Tree plantation" to all polygons with a "Commercial forestry" land-cover classification in the 2015 agriculture map;

(7) Assigned "Fallow/grassland" to all polygons with a "Pasture" land-cover classification in the 2015 agriculture map and a "Sugarcane" land-cover classification in the 2010 land-cover map;

(8) Assigned the 2010 land-cover classification as the 2017 land-cover classification for all polygons with a "Pasture" land-cover classification in the 2015 agriculture map and a land-cover classification other than "Sugarcane" in the 2010 land-cover map. The 2010 land-cover classification was retained as the 2017 land-cover classification to reflect the specific land-cover conditions in the 2010 land-cover map for these areas;

(9) Assigned "Fallow/grassland" to all remaining unassigned polygons with an agricultural land cover in the 2010 land-cover map;

(10) Assigned the 2010 land-cover classification as the 2017 land-cover classification for all remaining unassigned polygons;

(11) Reassigned polygons with "Alien forest," "Native forest," and "Tree plantation" land-cover classifications as "Alien forest, fog," "Native forest, fog," and "Tree plantation, fog," respectively, where these polygons have an elevation equal to or greater than 2,000 feet, the base of the fog-interception zone. These changes were done to identify polygons with forest land covers that may contribute fog interception;

(12) Reassigned polygons with "Alien forest," "Native forest," and "Tree plantation" land-cover classifications as "Alien forest, no fog," "Native forest, no fog," and "Tree plantation, no fog," respectively, where these polygons have an elevation below 2,000 feet, the base of the fog-interception zone. These changes were done to identify polygons with forest land covers that do not contribute fog interception;

(13) Reassigned polygons with a "Reservoir" land-cover classification and a Waikapu, Kahului, or Paia aquifer system designation as "Grassland." These changes were done to reflect the cessation of sugarcane in these areas in December 2016. The reservoirs in these areas had been used to supply irrigation water to nearby sugarcane fields. With the cessation of sugarcane cultivation, it was assumed that these reservoirs were no longer used to store water and would be dry;

(14) Reassigned polygons with a "Reservoir" land-cover classification and an Iao aquifer-system designation as "Reservoir, Iao". This change was done to reflect a higher rate of seepage loss reported for reservoirs in the Iao aquifer-system area as compared to other reservoirs on the island of Maui (Johnson and others, 2018);

(15) Reassigned polygons with a "Reservoir" land-cover classification and an aquifer-system designation other than Iao as "Reservoir, not Iao". This change was done to reflect a lower rate of seepage loss reported for reservoirs in aquifer-system areas other than Iao on the island of Maui (Johnson and others, 2018);

(16) Added and populated an "ilu2017" field to represent the land-cover code associated with each 2017 land-cover classification;

(17) Exported the 2017 land-cover table to a .csv file, hereinafter the Process Step 2 output.</procdesc><procdate>20171101</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>PROCESS STEP 3: Used a Python script developed in ArcGIS (ArcPy script) to merge small polygons with adjacent large polygons in the 2017 land-cover map. The main operations in this process step included the following:

(1) Imported the output .csv file from Process Step 2 into ArcGIS as a table;

(2) Joined the imported table with the output geodatabase feature class from Process Step 1;

(3) Used the ArcGIS Make Feature Layer, Select Layer by Attribute, and Eliminate tools to select polygons that had an area less than 0.1 acre and merge the selected polygons with adjacent larger polygons. Each selected polygon was merged with a neighboring unselected polygon by dropping the shared border with the neighboring unselected polygon that had the largest area. All polygons containing septic systems and cesspools, and polygons with "Water body," "Reservoir, not Iao," "Reservoir, Iao," and "Taro" land cover conditions were excluded from merging because these conditions represent potential recharge sources for the water-budget model;

(4) Step 3 was repeated until there were no further reductions in the number of polygons. The process of merging the small polygons with adjacent large polygons reduced the number of polygons by about 6 percent;

(5) Created the 2017 land-cover map by converting multi-part polygons to single-part polygons to allow users to assign their own land-cover classifications to individual polygons. The 2017 land-cover contains 505,294 polygons. The 2017 land-cover map is being used as a base map that can be modified to define land-cover classifications for a variety of future land-cover change scenarios. Hence, no additional aggregation of polygons was conducted to reduce the total number of polygons;

(6) Added a "POLYGON_ID" field and assigned unique identification number values to polygons;

(7) Removed all temporary and unnecessary fields from the attribute table;

(8) Exported the geodatabase feature class as a shapefile, hereinafter the Process Step 3 output.</procdesc><procdate>20171101</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>PROCESS STEP 4 (added for version 1.2): Used ArcGIS and a Python notebook to reassign the “fog” or “no fog” designations to polygons with forest land covers to reflect the delineation of the fog-interception zone used by Johnson and others (2018). The main operations in this process step included the following:

(1) In ArcGIS, added the polygon-number attributes from the 2010 land-cover map to the attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map (Process Step 3 output). The polygon-number attributes from the 2010 land-cover map were originally linked to the attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map during Process Step 3 and retained as part of the data archive during the creation of version 1.1.  However, the retention of this information was not described in version 1.1.  The ArcGIS Join Field tool was used to append the polygon-number attributes from the 2010 land-cover map to the attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map; 

(2) Exported the attribute table from the 2017 land-cover map to a .csv file;

(3) In Python notebook, imported the .csv file containing the attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map;

(4) Imported a table containing the attributes of each model subarea used in the water-budget-model calculations of Johnson and others (2018). This table was provided by the lead author of Johnson and others (2018) and it included fog-interception-zone designations (fog or no fog);

(5) Appended the fog-interception-zone designations used by Johnson and others (2018) to the table containing the attributes of the 2017 land-cover map using the polygon-number attribute from the 2010 land-cover map;

(6) Reassigned a “fog” or “no fog” designation to each polygon with a forested land cover in the 2017 land-cover map to match the fog-zone designations used by Johnson and others (2018);

(7) Exported the revised attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map to a .csv file;

(8) In ArcGIS, imported the revised attribute table of the 2017 land-cover map;

(9) Appended the revised 2017 land-cover designations to the Process Step 3 output;

(10) Removed all temporary and unnecessary fields from the shapefile's attribute table.</procdesc><procdate>20181018</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><ptvctinf><esriterm Name="Maui_PresentDay2017_Clip"><efeatyp Sync="TRUE">Simple</efeatyp><efeageom code="4" Sync="TRUE"></efeageom><esritopo Sync="TRUE">FALSE</esritopo><efeacnt Sync="TRUE">0</efeacnt><spindex Sync="TRUE">FALSE</spindex><linrefer Sync="TRUE">FALSE</linrefer></esriterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><planci><plance>coordinate pair</plance><coordrep><absres>0.6096</absres><ordres>0.6096</ordres></coordrep><plandu>METERS</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>D_North_American_1983</horizdn><ellips>GRS_1980</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222101</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed Name="Maui_PresentDay2017_Clip"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Table</enttypl><enttypd>Table containing attribute information associated with the data set.</enttypd><enttypds>Producer defined</enttypds><enttypt Sync="TRUE">Feature Class</enttypt><enttypc Sync="TRUE">0</enttypc></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>FID</attrlabl><attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom></attrdomv><attalias Sync="TRUE">FID</attalias><attrtype Sync="TRUE">OID</attrtype><attwidth Sync="TRUE">4</attwidth><atprecis Sync="TRUE">0</atprecis><attscale Sync="TRUE">0</attscale></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl><attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom></attrdomv><attalias Sync="TRUE">Shape</attalias><attrtype Sync="TRUE">Geometry</attrtype><attwidth Sync="TRUE">0</attwidth><atprecis Sync="TRUE">0</atprecis><attscale Sync="TRUE">0</attscale></attr><attr><attrlabl>LC_2017</attrlabl><attrdef>Name of land cover or vegetation, 2017</attrdef><attrdefs>Originator</attrdefs><attrdomv><edom><edomv>Alien forest, fog</edomv><edomvd>Land cover is alien forest.
