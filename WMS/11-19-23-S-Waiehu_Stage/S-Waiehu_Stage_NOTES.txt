3: Clean out digital dams: run Cleandam: - Make sure 2d grid module is active, - Select GSSHA | Clean Digital Dams    - hit close


6) Import Soil data 
6.1) Create Soil Type Coverage
- Right-click Coverages folderselect New Coverage, Change Type to Soil Type
6.2) Right click GIS data on left, add shapefile data: Used: 
Ssurgo_Soils_data_fromWMS--> Soils_v1_ssurgo--> soilmu_a_hi980.shp
6.3) Right click on soilmu_a_hi980.shp and select Join NRCS Data. (see S_Waiehu_Basin_deliniated_0p1.wms notes for details) 


6.4) convert the shape file to a coverage: 
  -  Right-click on the GSSHA coverage and select Zoom To Layer to set the current view so you are zoomed to your GSSHA model.
  - Click on the Soil Type coverage in the Coverages list to make it the active coverage.
  - Select the soil.....shp GIS layer by clicking on it. This will change the active module to the GIS module.
 -  Click the Select shapes tool and drag a rectangle around (and a little outside) the watershed to select the soil polygons that overlay the watershed.
  - In the GIS Module, select Mapping | Shapes -> Feature Objects.  Select Soil shp, deselect all others 
 Select Next. Notice that the fields should be mapped properly. Click Next again. Select Finish and wait for WMS to convert the selected shapes to feature objects in the map module. 


7) Create an Index Map from Soil Data
  - Switch to the 2D Grid Module Select GSSHA | Maps  For the Input coverage (1), use the Soil Type coverage.
  - Coverage Attribute is set to Texture. Change the Index map name to SoilType
  - Click on the Coverages -> Index Map button.

8) Add infiltration before dealing with land use, In Job control Turned on Greene and Apmpt soil infiltration. 

- Select GGSHA --> Map Tables  Select  Using Index Map SoilType  --> Infiltration Tab. 
- Select Generate IDS. 
- Copy and paste the following parameters into the middle rows which remain 0s 
based off of  https://www.gsshawiki.com/Infiltration:Parameter_Estimates

NOTE  it is likely that these high conductivities in zones 1 and 9  may want to be changed to lower considering urban land use

9)  land use:  Create Land Use Coverage
- Right-click Coverages folder select New Coverage, Change Type to Land Use

9.2) Right click GIS data on left, add shapefile data: Used: Data --> GIS --> Land_Cover_Future_Brewington --> Maui_PresentDay2017_Clip_CN.shp

With the add shapefile r-click on the GIS data tab
- Select all shapes, In the GIS Module, select Mapping | Shapes -> Feature Objects. Select Next  
    - LUCODE should map to LandUse,  
    - I mapped description to name. 

9.3) Create an Index Map from land use 
   - with grid selected go to GSSHA at top,  --> Maps
   - input coverage LandUse,  
   - Map Name Land_UsePresDay
   - Click on the Coverages -> Index Map button.


8.4 Assign index maps Roughness vlaues 
   - with grid selected go to GSSHA at top,  select Map Tables  On Roughness Tab: 
   - Using Map Hi_Intensity_LU Generate IDS: 
   - Wont automatically Map, need to use the following table to map: These calcilations are in excel sheet called 
Roughness_table_maker_from_LU_SHP.xlsx in AdSci_Watershed\Data\GIS\Land_Cover_Future_Brewington\Development_Scenarios

8.5) Also need to define an initial moisture.  This is best accomplished with many model run days beforehand in long-term Sim. But because we are just comparing the different land use effects here we will just hold this constant. 

 - with grid selected go to GSSHA at top,  select Maps...
 - use Data Calculator
 - Sdelect any existing map, 
 - in the expression field put in 1 
 - in the result field put in Uniform_Init_Moisture_Code
 - be sure index map box is checked
 - Click Compute and it will make a new map 

Then - with grid selected go to GSSHA at top,  select Map Tables  On Initial moisture Tab: 
 - using Uniform_Init_Moisture_Code
 - Generate IDs
 - There is one unit, I assigned initial moisture as 30% or 0.3
