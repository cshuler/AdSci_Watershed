- in arc clipped and projected dem into WGS84-UTMz4n
- added DEM_clip300mUTM.tif to GIS data in WMS - then r-click and converted to project DEM (Accepted defaults cell size etc)  
- Identified Outlet points on shapemap, imported file into WMS, manually made outlet points on flow accumulation areas
- Used deliniate basins wizard to make basins, defualt parameters



Following the Tutorial file WMS_TUTORIALS-Vol_2.pdf

The first step in creating a GSSHA model using WMS is to delineate a watershed and obtain a watershed boundary polygon from a digital elevation model.

1) In the Drainage Module , select DEM | Compute TOPAZ Flow Data and Click OK twice to accept the default TOPAZ input.
- saved Topaz files to a specified directory, 
- changed units to acres and meters
- kept model units current projection
- ran the topaz program 

2) need to create an outlet point to delineate a watershed. Create test one by using the Create Outlet Point button at the location where there is a USGS gauge used Ad_Sci_USGS_gauges.shp to see and manually plopped outlet point on the southernmost stream gauge

3)  Select DEM | Delineate Basins Wizard   used a default threshold of 320 acres (took a while to run) 

Save point: Exp2_sp_1p0_Basin_deliniated

4) Create grid within the deliniated basin Switch to Map Module by Click on Select Feature Polygon Tool and right click anywhere within the watershed polygon. Select Create Grid.(pg 1-4)  (for testing used base cell size of 100 (10 is better and 5 is max for 5m dem) use defaults for interpolate elevations from DEM and other otopns.
