Step 0.1 
- in arc clipped and projected dem into WGS84-UTMz4n
- added DEM_clip300mUTM.tif to GIS data in WMS - then r-click and converted to project DEM (Accepted defaults cell size etc)  
- Identified Outlet points on shapemap, imported file into WMS, manually made outlet points on flow accumulation areas
- Used deliniate basins wizard to make basins, defualt parameters



Following the Tutorial file WMS_TUTORIALS-Vol_2.pdf

The first step in creating a GSSHA model using WMS is to delineate a watershed and obtain a watershed boundary polygon from a digital elevation model.

1) In the Drainage Module , select DEM | Compute TOPAZ Flow Data and Click OK twice to accept the default TOPAZ input.
- saved Topaz files to a specified directory, 
- changed units to acres and meters
- kept model units current projection
- ran the topaz program 

2) need to create an outlet point to delineate a watershed. Create test one by using the Create Outlet Point button at the location where there is a USGS gauge used Ad_Sci_USGS_gauges.shp to see and manually plopped outlet point on the southernmost stream gauge

3)  Select DEM | Delineate Basins Wizard   used a default threshold of 320 acres (took a while to run) 

Save point 1: Exp2_sp_1p0_Basin_deliniatedm  (Note go back to here to change grid cell size) 

4) Create grid within the deliniated basin Switch to Map Module by Click on Select Feature Polygon Tool and right click anywhere within the watershed polygon. Select Create Grid.(pg 1-4)  (for testing used base cell size of 100 (10 is better and 5 is max for 5m dem) use defaults for interpolate elevations from DEM and other otopns. 

5) Clean out digital dams: run Cleandam: 
- Make sure 2d grid module is active
- Select GSSHA | Clean Digital Dams    - hit close



6) Import Soil data 
6.1) Create Soil Type Coverage
- Right-click Coverages folderselect New Coverage, Change Type to Soil Type
6.2) Right click GIS data on left, add shapefile data: Used: 
Ssurgo_Soils_data_fromWMS--> Soils_v1_ssurgo--> soilmu_a_hi980.shp
6.3) Right click on soilmu_a_hi980.shp and select Join NRCS Data.  Toggle the Fill blank values and Compute Hydraulicâ€¦ options on. and just click OK. (note that this seems to just populate the shapefile attribute table, not exactly sure where it gets the data.  My best recollection is that I pulled that shapefile data off of the NRCS website with one of their whacky searches, no idea what parameters I used....) 
6.4) convert the shape file to a coverage: 
  -  Right-click on the GSSHA coverage and select Zoom To Layer to set the current view so you are zoomed to your GSSHA model.
  - Click on the Soil Type coverage in the Coverages list to make it the active coverage.
  - Select the soil.....shp GIS layer by clicking on it. This will change the active module to the GIS module.
 -  Click the Select shapes tool and drag a rectangle around (and a little outside) the watershed to select the soil polygons that overlay the watershed.
  - In the GIS Module, select Mapping | Shapes -> Feature Objects. Select Next. Notice that the fields should be mapped properly. Click Next again. Select Finish and wait for WMS to convert the selected shapes to feature objects in the map module. 

Save point 3: Exp2_sp_3p0_Soils_Mapped

7) Create an Index Map from Soil Data
  - Switch to the 2D Grid Module Select GSSHA | Maps  For the Input coverage (1), use the Soil Type coverage.
  - Coverage Attribute is set to Texture. Change the Index map name to SoilType
  - Click on the Coverages -> Index Map button.

8)  7.2) Creating a Mapping Table from the Index Map Just use the soils data for roughness:
- opened the map tables dialog in the GSSHA tab of the 2d grid module
- used this report from 1940whateva to select some stand in roughness coefficients   https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/2339/report.pdf

- Cemented material = 0.018
- Silt loam         = 0.032
- Cobbly silty clay = 0.050
- Silty clay loam   = 0.025
- Bedrock           = 0.025
- Clay              = 0.020
- Silty clay        = 0.025

9) Adding Infiltartion 
  - In 2D Grid Module select GSSHA | Map Tables, Select the Infiltration tab.Yes to open Job Control window to turn on infiltration. (in Job Control) Infiltration heading, select Green + Ampt with soil moisture redistribution. Select OK (In map tables again) Using Index Map drop down box, choose Soil Type. Click on Generate IDs button. 

It comes with values for
Hk, Field capacity and wilting point, but we need: 

Capilary head
Porosity
Pore distribution index
residual saturation 

for Capilary head  using https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Theoretical-Height-of-Capillary-Rise-in-Sediments_tbl1_267258295, 
Fine silt ~ Silty clay loam = 7500 cm(Actuakly change to 100) and bedrock ~gravel = 15 cm

for porosity, basically estimated, used https://structx.com/Soil_Properties_006.html kind of maybe 

for pore size distribution, uses https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235170344_In_Situ_Soil_Venting_-_Full_Scale_Test_Hill_AFB_Guidance_Document_Volume_2
Using 1.8 for both 

Residual saturation using https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Soil-Texture-Saturated-Hydraulic-Conductivity-K-s-Saturated-q-s-and-Residual-q_tbl1_251424212
 using 0.02 for bedrock and 0.06 for Clay loam
