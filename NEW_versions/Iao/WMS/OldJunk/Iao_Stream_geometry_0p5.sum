mass cleanup error from overland:             0.000000 m3

Note: no rainfall was input.

THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS ARE GIVEN:
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Mass conservation error is larger than typical values (<1 percent).
 This indicates a problem with your data set, or that you are using the model
 to simulate an extreme event which violates one or more assumptions made
 in the development of GSSHA.  You should first check for errors in the
 channel inputs, including cross-sectional data.  A decrease in the model
 time step may also help alleviate this problem.


 THE FOLLOWING INPUTS WERE READ:
A WMS Project File was used.
Floating point GRASS maps were read.
Locations where discharge hydrographs are to be written.

 THE FOLLOWING PROCESSES WERE SIMULATED:
Explicit diffusive-wave channel routing.
Distributed overland roughness.
Distributed initial soil moisture.
Infiltration with redistribution.

 THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT MAPS WERE WRITTEN EVERY 30 TIMESTEP(S):
Soil surface moisture maps were output.
Infiltration rate maps were output.
ASCII WMS maps of:
     overland flow depth.
     channel depth.

 THE FOLLOWING ASCII OUTPUT FILES WERE WRITTEN TO EVERY 30 TIMESTEP(S):
     hydrograph at the catchment outlet.
     hydrographs at selected locations.
