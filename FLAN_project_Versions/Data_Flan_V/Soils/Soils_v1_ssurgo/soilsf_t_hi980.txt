"HI980"|3|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is hard or soft bedrock.|"237943"
"HI980"|3|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area that has less than 15 percent rock fragments. Typically 0.1 to 2 acres.|"237944"
"HI980"|3|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically 0.2 to 2 acres.|"237945"
"HI980"|3|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth. Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock or where Rock outcrop is a named component of the map unit. Typically 0.1 to 2 acres.|"237946"
"HI980"|3|"STN"|"Stony spot"|A spot where 0.01 to 0.1 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surrounding soil has no surface stones. Typically 0.1 to 2 acres.|"237947"
"HI980"|3|"STV"|"Very stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3.0 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the surrounding soil is covered by less than 0.01 percent stones. Typically 0.1 to 2 acres.|"237948"
