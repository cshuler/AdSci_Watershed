  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
    Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
    derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
    application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
    reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
    authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
    users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.

    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 10 acres in areas of low-intensity mapping (Order 3),
    about 1 acre in areas of high intensity mapping  (Order 2), and
    about 20 acres in areas of reconnaissance mapping (Order 4).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

      Process_Description:
        The Islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai,
        and Lanai, State of Hawaii Soil Survey was published in 1972 at
        1:24,000 scale.  The classification and map unit names were
        finalized at the final correlation in 1968.  An evaluation was
        made of the soil survey in 1993.  It was determined that the soil
        map unit delineations were accurate.  Four additional map units
        were added to the soil survey.  The changes were made to reflect
        present day soil survey concepts, soil classification, and soil
        interpretations.  Amendments to the correlation document reflecting
        these changes are on file at the NRCS Hawaii State Office.  The
        additional map units are as follows:

        W-----Water
        QU----Quarry
        CPI---Cinder Pit

      Process_Description:
        Field work on the soil survey for the Islands
        of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, State of Hawaii were
        completed in 1965.  Three kinds of survey were made on the island.
        A high-intensity survey on cultivated areas; a low-intensity survey
        on grazing and forested lands; and a reconnaissance survey on
        inaccessible areas.  Field procedures for the soil survey included
        plotting of soil boundaries determined by field observation and by
        interpretation of aerial photographs.  Boundaries were verified at
        closely spaced intervals, and the soils in each delineation were
        identified by traversing the landscape. Soil scientists described and
        sampled the soils, and analyzed samples in the laboratory.  The
        classification and map unit names were finalized at the final
        correlation in 1966.  The soil survey for the Islands of Kauai, Oahu,
        Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, State of Hawaii was published in 1972, at
        1:24,000 scale.

      Process_Description:
        Soil map unit delineations and special soil
        features were manually recompiled from 1:24,000 scale multiple
        high altitude aerial photographs onto 7 mil. annotated overlays
        that were registered to multiple orthophotographs.  The soil
        delineation overlays were manually digitized using NRCS GRASS
        Version 4.0 and 4.13.  Four control points corresponding to the
        four corners of the orthophotographs were used for registration
        during digital data collection. The processing, map neatline
        development, labeling, edge matching, and editing, were done in
        NRCS GRASS Version 4.0 and 4.13. The control points were explicitly
        entered, and were determined by converting geographic coordinates
        to UTM coordinates using m.proj. The Old Hawaiian datum was used for
        horizontal accuracy. This datum is based on the Clarke 1866
        spheroid, and is an equivalent standard to the North American
        Datum of 1927. The data were written to Digital Line Graph
        optional format with the v.export command. Compilation,
        digitizing, and quality control were performed by the soil
        scientists and cartographic technicians at the Hawaii Natural
        Resources Conservation Service State Office.

        together into a seamless soil survey area coverage and additional
        editing using the USGS 7.5 minute digital raster graphics as the
        base map was performed.  Mylar plots of digital raster graphics and
        the soil layer at 1:24,000 scale were checked for accuracy and
        completeness.  New DLGs reflecting these changes were written with
        ARC/INFO 7.1.2.

        The spatial data for the soil survey of Island
        of Maui, Hawaii was downloaded from the Soil Data Mart
        on October 15, 2012.  The individual shapefiles were appended into a
        geodatabase for the Pacific Islands.  The data were processed in
        ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a 0.1 meter cluster tolerance
        for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps within the Islands
        soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data were exported as
        shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.  A datum transformation
        from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum
        transformation method was applied to the data.  The data were checked
        with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S. Department of
        Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles
        were then uploaded to the soil data warehouse for archival and
        distribution.

        The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
        of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
        and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
        using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
        an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
        Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
        The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is Hawaii Albers
        Equal Area Conic and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
        meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
        meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
        generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
        The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2
        meters.  This effort directly affects the gSSURGO and gNATSGO product since
        these deliverables are in a File Geodatabase format.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
      map unit key is used to link to information in the National
      Soil Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
      area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
      each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
