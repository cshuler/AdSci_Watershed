This component is on alluvial fans and stream terraces alluvial fans, Haleakala shield volcanoes. The parent material consists of volcanic ash derived from basalt over alluvium derived from basalt. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is excessively drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 4s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 20 percent.

Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. There is no zone of water saturation within a depth of 72 inches. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 6s. Irrigated land capability classification is 6s. This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 1 percent.  "|"18294079"|"18389209"
